## Discussion, Issue Reports, and Suggestions

We do all of our discussion through [Github issues](https://github.com/talbertherndon/FlashcardX/issues). There, you can discuss FlashcardX and its code, suggest features with the `enhancement` label, report bugs with the `bug` label, and make other contributions.

### Guidelines for Bug Reports

We treat all bug reports very seriously. In order to improve FlashcardX as quickly as possible, we appreciate detailed, thorough bug reports. 

Excellent bug reports include the following:

 - Some kind of summary or background
 - Steps to reproduce the bug
 - What you expected to happen
 - What actually happened
 - Screenshots, if possible
 - Notes, if you have any

### Guidelines for Suggestions

Excellent feature suggestions include the following:

- A clear and descriptive title for your suggestion
- A description of the need for your new feature, including at least one specific use case, with as many details as possible
- A description of how someone would use your new feature, with as many details as possible
- An outline of the exact behavior of your new feature, again with as many details as possible, ideally including examples
- A description of how your feature is different from any similar previously suggested features, if any

### Endorsing Suggestions

Endorsing other suggestions gives us a good gauge of what the FlashcardX community wants to see in our platform. If you see a proposed feature that you would like to see added, please leave a comment on the page containing the suggestion. This comment could be a simple statement showing your approval (e.g. "I like this!") or it could also list additional use cases in which the proposed feature would be useful which were not mentioned elsewhere.
